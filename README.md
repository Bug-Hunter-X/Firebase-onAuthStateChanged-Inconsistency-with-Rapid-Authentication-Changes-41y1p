# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener where rapid changes in authentication state can lead to inconsistent behavior.

## Bug Description

The `onAuthStateChanged` listener may fail to trigger correctly if the authentication status changes very quickly (e.g., immediately signing out after signing in).  This inconsistency can result in the user interface not updating accurately, leading to unexpected application behavior.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm start`
4. Observe the console logs and the UI updates as you rapidly sign in and out.

## Solution

The provided solution introduces a debounce mechanism to handle rapid authentication state changes. This helps to ensure that the listener only triggers after a short delay, preventing inconsistencies and enabling correct UI updates.
